Kevin B,"Excellent game, super fun, but there is one problem I have noticed. I am unable to play on mobile data, when I try to join any room, it after the countdown, it just endlessly loads, but doesn't join the game. Sometimes it works if I choose the random room option, but after one match or so, it goes back to the endless loading. I have tried reinstalling it, clearing cache / data, etc, but nothing helps. If you could help me with this, I would much appreciate it.","June 25, 2021"
A Google user,"Pay 2 win, that's all you need to know, and if you're wondering, this used to be a good game you could play with family and friends but was ruined with a U.I. update, and the fact that even if you spent money on previous builds, you lost all pro pack, and had to grind to get basics guns back. Gameplay is good, but overall would be better if old UI was back. So then I wouldn't have to rely on luck to unlock other guns and make it a fair fight.","April 12, 2020"
Juvannie Lynch,"This version is subpar to the original version of mini, anyone who played back in the day would agree. I downloaded it to play with my friends. I can't get back my pro pack cause the date to renew it is gone. Nice one. I spent money on the game and can't get my stuff. You barely get any full 6 man matches because they separated the maps. And when you do get in a game the 1 and 2 man quit. They just added ads and removed it back. Idk why the devs are ruining what used to be a great game.","May 25, 2020"
